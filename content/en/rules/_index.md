1. The start is at the [central parking lot](//mapy.cz/s/keneluzuma) in JÃ¡nskÃ©
   LÃ¡znÄ›. It's possible to start from some other place which is not further
   than 2 kilometers from the aforementioned place (in that case, the route
   can't be shorter than nominal 51 kilometers).

    in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.
